This document explains the Product Extension to the [SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec) (STAC) specification.

This extension provides a generic framework to describe products related to the data in a STAC catalog.
A product is a package offer of the STAC item and thus describes properties specific to the product packaging and its distribution.
Several products may be specified at assets level, each with its own properties.
This extension is intended to be adapted by other extensions that provide best practises or definitions about the product like
specific dictionaries for the product type or the timeliness of the product.

- Examples:
  - [Item example](examples/item.json): Shows the basic usage of the extension in a STAC Item
  - [Collection example](examples/collection.json): Shows the basic usage of the extension in a STAC Collection
- [JSON Schema](json-schema/schema.json)
- [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)

## Fields

- [ ] Catalogs
- [x] Collections
- [x] Item Properties (incl. Summaries in Collections)

## Contributing

All contributions are subject to the
[STAC Specification Code of Conduct](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
For contributions, please follow the
[STAC specification contributing guide](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) Instructions
for running tests are copied here for convenience.

### Running tests

The same checks that run as checks on PR's are part of the repository and can be run locally to verify that changes are valid. 
To run tests locally, you'll need `npm`, which is a standard part of any [node.js installation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

First you'll need to install everything with npm once. Just navigate to the root of this repository and on 
your command line run:
```bash
npm install
```

Then to check markdown formatting and test the examples against the JSON schema, you can run:
```bash
npm test
```

This will spit out the same texts that you see online, and you can then go and fix your markdown or examples.

If the tests reveal formatting problems with the examples, you can fix them with:
```bash
npm run format-examples
```
